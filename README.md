This project is a Chrome Extension designed to track the amount of time users spend on different websites and generate detailed productivity analytics. It helps users gain insights into their online habits by categorizing websites as productive (e.g., coding platforms, educational sites) or unproductive (e.g., social media, entertainment), and offers a visual dashboard to analyze weekly activity patterns.
The extension operates in the background and uses Chrome’s built-in APIs to monitor active browser tabs. It records how long each domain is visited and periodically sends that data to a backend server. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, which enables persistent tracking and historical analysis.
A simple Node.js + Express backend handles API endpoints for storing and retrieving tracking data. This backend also serves a web-based dashboard that visualizes the user’s time distribution using charts powered by Chart.js.
Key Features:
🕒 Tracks time spent on each domain in real-time
📡 Sends data securely to the backend for storage
📁 Uses MongoDB to store per-site usage logs
📊 Displays bar chart of time spent per site via dashboard
✅ Classifies websites into productive and unproductive categories
📅 Provides weekly usage summaries
Technology Stack:
Frontend (Chrome Extension): HTML, JavaScript, Chrome Extension APIs
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Dashboard: HTML, CSS, Chart.js
This project demonstrates a real-world application of browser automation, real-time data tracking, and full-stack web development. It’s a useful personal productivity tool and can be extended further with features like user authentication, productivity scoring, and daily reminders or reports.
